# Background&Motivation

Volatility in oil prices brings uncertainty to energy transition projects and affects the capital cost for investors. Fluctuations in oil prices also influence the relative competitiveness of various energy sources such as natural gas, coal, and renewables, thus affecting investment patterns and the capital costs related to energy projects (Lin & Cheung, 2024). A comprehensive understanding of the implications of oil price volatility is necessary as it enhances risk management strategies and shapes investment decisions in the energy transition field.

Previous studies have proved that various aspects can play a role in shaping the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of energy transition. For instance, mature technologies benefit from lower costs due to reduced risks, while emerging ones face higher costs due to market uncertainties (Egli et al., 2021). Policy and regulatory risks also impact WACC. Clear subsidies and stable frameworks lower costs for renewable technologies, while stricter emission regulations raise costs for fossil fuels (Zhou et al., 2021). Moreover, country-specific risks, like economic stability and investment environments, cause disparities, with developed nations having lower WACC than emerging economies. Different energy technologies have different WACC levels. Renewables require higher initial investments and are thus more sensitive to capital costs (Polzin et al., 2021).
  
Similarly, the impact of oil price fluctuations on WACC is a complex issue that has been studied in various academic works. Studies (Calcaterra et al., 2024) emphasize the importance of fair finance in ensuring energy availability and sustainability. Empirical analyses have shown that the cost of capital (CoC) varies across countries and technologies, and developing countries often have higher CoC due to higher perceived risks (Fuso Nerini et al., 2017). Integrating these financial dynamics into climate policy and the energy transition is crucial for understanding the implications of oil price volatility on investment decisions and the global shift towards sustainable energy sources.
