## Application Scenarios:

The dataset for this study comes from industries closely linked to the energy sector, such as renewable energy, fossil fuels, and finance. Data sources include historical oil price datasets from global energy markets (e.g., Brent Crude and WTI prices), investment cost data for renewable technologies (e.g., solar, wind, and hydropower), and financial metrics like the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) across different energy projects. These datasets are directly in line with the research question as they help analyze the relationships between oil price volatility, market perceptions, and WACC in energy transition projects. Historical oil price trends are essential for forecasting future volatility using machine learning models, while financial data on investment costs and WACC allow for scenario simulations of how different oil price levels affect capital allocation

Consequently, Energy companies can use these findings to make strategic investment decisions, and policymakers can formulate regulations to stabilize the impact of oil price volatility on energy financing. Financial institutions will benefit from a clearer understanding of the associated risks, allowing for more informed investment strategies. Moreover, this research supports sustainable development goals by ensuring accessible energy financing, especially in developing countries, and helps mitigate climate change by influencing the pace of the global shift towards low-carbon energy systems.
